      "Synopsis of Animal 2023 Movie \n",
      " Ranvijay \"Vijay\" Singh is the son of Balbir Singh, a Delhi-based business magnate who heads the generational steel company, \"Swastik Steels\". Vijay resides in a palatial mansion with Balbir, his mother, Jyoti, and sisters Reet and Roop. Vijay has adored Balbir from his childhood, but Balbir does not spend time with the family due to his busy schedule. One day, Reet gets bullied by her collegemates, and Vijay learns about this and warns them with an AK-47 and chases them. Balbir learns about this and sends him away to a boarding school in the US. Vijay returns to Delhi after completing his education, where he attends the engagement of his former school classmate Geetanjali. Vijay always has feelings for Geetanjali and confesses to her that she would be much better off with Vijay as he is an alpha male, which leads to Geetanjali instantly falling for him and breaking her engagement. During Balbir's 60th birthday, Vijay fights with Reet's husband Varun Pratap Malhotra. One thing leads to another and Vijay is kicked out of the house. Vijay immediately marries Geetanjali and moves to the US. Geetanjali gives birth to two children and they all lead a peaceful life. Eight years later, Vijay learns that Balbir was shot by unidentified assailants, prompting him to return to India and meet his father. Upon reuniting with Balbir and the family, Vijay takes charge and sets out to find the person responsible for the attempt on Balbir. Vijay goes to his native village in Punjab, where he asks for help from his extended family, apologizing in the process for his father and his family's absence, for not having visited them in the past twenty years. Vijay's extended family accepted his apologies and processed his concerns, eventually sending his cousins with him back to Delhi. Vijay sets up a doppelgänger named Kailash for Balbir, where Kailash is eventually killed by Asrar Haque's men. At Kailash's funeral, Vijay finds out that Varun was involved in the assassination attempt, where he kills him at a meeting as Asrar Haque watches the murder. Shortly afterward, Vijay goes to meet an arms dealer named Freddy, at a hotel, where Asrar Haque and his assailants donning animal masks, arrive at the hotel to kill him. However, Vijay manages to vanquish them despite brutal injuries and goes into a coma. Two weeks later upon waking from his coma, Vijay learns that he has heart failure and needs an immediate transplant. Vijay finally finds a donor and successfully recovers, where he learns that the donor is the fiancé of a woman named Zoya. Vijay meets and begins to spend time with her to ease her pain of losing her fiancé, which leads to an affair. Zoya, who has fallen in love with Vijay, reveals that the donor was not her fiancé and that she was sent by Asrar's younger brother Abrar to honey-trap him. Vijay learns that Asrar was the actual perpetrator behind Balbir's assassination attempt. Asrar's younger brothers Abid and Abrar found out everything about Vijay and sent her to him. Vijay reveals that he knew earlier that she was sent by someone and that he wanted to know the identity of the actual perpetrator. Later, Vijay learns from his grandfather Rajdheer Singh that Abrar and his brothers are related to their family, making Vijay their cousin. Asrar tried to assassinate Balbir after he was denied a share of their property. Vijay learns that Abrar has relocated to Scotland and changed his religion, plotting revenge. Vijay and his cousins barge into his house to kill him, where he kills Abrar's men and threatens Abrar's wives to reveal his whereabouts. Abrar's wives reveal that Abrar had escaped with Abid and plans to leave for another country in their private jet. Vijay and his men give chase to them on the runway, managing to stop their flight. A brutal fight ensues, where Vijay finally kills Abrar and returns to India. During their Diwali celebration, Balbir reveals to Vijay that he has terminal cancer and realizes that his upbringing is the reason behind Vijay's aggression. Balbir finally apologizes and reconciles with Vijay, who is overjoyed after finally receiving familial love and affection from Balbir. In the post-credits scene, Asrar, Abid, and Abrar's other younger brother Aziz, a professional assassin in Istanbul, learn that Vijay was responsible for killing Asrar and Abrar. After successfully undergoing plastic surgery to become Vijay's doppelgänger, Aziz and Abid set out to exact vengeance on Vijay and his family.\n"
